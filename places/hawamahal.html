    <h2>About Hawa Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Hawa Mahal</strong>, also known as the "Palace of Winds", is one of Jaipur’s most famous landmarks. 
      Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the palace is known for its unique honeycomb-like façade with 953 small windows called <em>jharokhas</em>. 
      These windows were designed so royal ladies could observe street festivals and city life while staying unseen.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The red and pink sandstone structure reflects Rajput architectural brilliance and offers stunning views of the Jaipur cityscape and the Jantar Mantar from its top floors.
